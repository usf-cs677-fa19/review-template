# Research Paper Review Template

Use this template to write your research paper reviews with LaTeX. Edit
review.tex with your content, then use the supplied build scripts to generate a
PDF. You will need a LaTeX distribution such as TeXLive or MacTex to use these
files. Alternatively, you can use [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com) for a
web-based solution.
